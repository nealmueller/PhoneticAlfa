# Phonetic Alfa
Phonetic Alfa is an iOS app that converts any typed or pasted text into NATO phonetic words in real time. It ignores spaces and most punctuation, turns “-” into “Dash,” keeps digits as digits, and includes one-tap output copy plus optional text-to-speech. iPhone-only, iOS 17+, offline, and stateless.

Phonetic Alfa does not collect, store, or share any personal data. The app works entirely on-device, does not use analytics, and does not transmit data over the network. Input and output are not saved. The app only writes the translated output to the clipboard when you tap the output area.
