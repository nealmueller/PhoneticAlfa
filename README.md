# Phonetic Alfa

Phonetic Alfa turns any short code or text into clear NATO phonetic words so you can read it out loud without mistakes. It is fast, offline, and simple.

Why it helps
- Read confirmation numbers and codes over the phone
- Avoid misheard letters (B vs D, M vs N, etc.)
- One tap to copy or speak the readback

How to use
1) Type your code.
2) Tap the readback to copy it.
3) Tap Speak to hear it out loud.

Privacy
Phonetic Alfa does not collect, store, or share any personal data. The app works entirely on-device, does not use analytics, and does not transmit data over the network. Input and output are not saved. The app only writes the translated output to the clipboard when you tap the output area.
